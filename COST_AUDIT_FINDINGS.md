## ⚠️ ITEMS REQUIRING RATE VERIFICATION

### MEP Breakdown
**Current**: Blanket $7/SF
**TechRidge Actual**: $10/SF broken down as:
- Fire protection: $3.00/SF
- Plumbing: $1.50/SF
- HVAC: $2.25/SF
- Electrical: $3.25/SF

**Recommendation**: Break out MEP into individual systems with discrete rates, or adjust blanket rate to $10/SF.

### Post-Tensioning Rate
**Our Calculation**: Uses cost database rate
**TechRidge**: 2.0 lbs/SF for 8" slabs (85,792 SF × 2.0 = 171,584 lbs @ $1.10/LB = $188,742)
**Recommendation**: Verify our rate matches 1.25-2.0 lbs/SF depending on slab thickness.

### General Conditions Method
**Our Default**: Percentage method (9.37%)
**TechRidge**: Monthly method (26 months @ $191,008/month)
**Status**: Both methods available in app - verify user can select monthly rate.

## 📈 EXPECTED OUTCOME

**Current Model Total**: $11,158,985
**Add Tier 1-3 Items**: +$2,146,173
**Expected New Total**: ~$13,305,158
**TechRidge Budget**: $12,272,200
**New Variance**: +$1,032,958 (+8.4%)

**Analysis**: After adding critical missing items, our model would be ~8% over TechRidge budget. This is acceptable because:
1. Our GSF is 1.5% larger (129K vs 127K)
2. Our stall count is 12% higher (357 vs 319) - more efficient layout
3. Some TechRidge items are optional (EV chargers, canopies, etc.)
4. General Conditions may differ based on schedule assumptions

---

## 🔍 NEXT STEPS

1. **Review findings with user** - Confirm which missing items should be added
2. **Update cost database** - Add new line items with proper unit costs
3. **Modify cost_engine.py** - Implement new calculation methods
4. **Test with TechRidge config** - Verify results match within 5-10%
5. **Document changes** - Update IMPLEMENTATION.md with new phase
6. **Create user documentation** - Explain which features are optional vs standard
